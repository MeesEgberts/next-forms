# Introduction

`next-server-actions` is a utility package for Next.js designed to simplify and enhance your experience working with server actions. It provides a collection of tools that help you build cleaner, more maintainable applications by extending the native Next.js and React APIs.

Key features include:

- **Middleware**: Easily enforce rules—like user authentication—before executing specific server actions.
- **Context Sharing**: Avoid repetitive code by using a shared context to pass data and functions between server actions.
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Catch and handle errors uniformly across all your server actions.
- **Logging**: Automatically log server actions to improve debugging and application monitoring.

Whether you're building small features or large applications, `next-server-actions` helps keep your codebase organized and efficient.
