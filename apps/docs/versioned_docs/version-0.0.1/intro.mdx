# Introduction

The motivation behind **`next-forms`** is to simplify and streamline how forms work in **Next.js**, especially when using [Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions). While working with forms and server actions in production projects, I ran into a few common pain points:

1. ✅ A generic and consistent way to return errors from server actions.
2. 🔄 Managing form submission states and loading indicators without boilerplate.
3. ⚠️ Handling both **field-level** and **form-level** validation errors gracefully.
4. 🧩 Easily attaching **middleware** (e.g. authentication or authorization) to server actions.
5. 🔁 Avoiding repetition when writing common logic like user/session checks in multiple actions.

These challenges led to the creation of `next-forms` — a lightweight and declarative form utility designed to make working with server actions more productive and enjoyable.

Whether you're building a simple contact form or a complex multi-step wizard, `next-forms` helps you write less code and focus more on what matters: your application logic.
