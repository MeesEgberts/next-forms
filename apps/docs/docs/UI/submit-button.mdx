# Submit Button

Because `next-server-actions` is built on top of [`next/form`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/form), you can leverage the native `useFormStatus` hook from `react-dom` to track the submission state of a form.

This is especially useful for disabling the submit button while the form is being processed and showing a loading indicator.

---

## Example

```tsx title="app/_components/submit-button.tsx"
"use client";

import { useFormStatus } from "react-dom";

export function SubmitButton() {
  const { pending } = useFormStatus();

  return (
    <button type="submit" disabled={pending}>
      {pending ? "Submitting..." : "Submit"}
    </button>
  );
}
```

:::warning
 The `useFormStatus` hook must be used inside a component that's a child of the `<Form>` component from `next/form`.
