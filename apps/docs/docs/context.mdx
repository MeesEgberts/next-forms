# Context

The `context` feature allows you to inject shared data into all your server actions.

For example, instead of calling `getUser()` in every individual action, you can call it once in the `context` function. The returned object will be automatically passed as the **second argument** to all server actions.

This helps reduce duplication and keeps your action logic clean and focused.

---

## Defining Context

You can define a shared context using the `context` option when creating your server action client. The `context` function must return an object, which can contain any data your server actions might need.

```tsx title="app/_lib/utils/server-actions.ts"
import { createClient } from "next-server-actions";
import { getUser } from "../../_data/get-user";

export const createServerAction = createClient({
  // highlight-start
  context: async () => {
    const user = await getUser();

    return { user };
  }
  // highlight-end
});
```

---

## Accessing Context in Actions

The context object you return becomes the **second argument** in all server action handlers.

```tsx title="app/_lib/actions/sign-in.ts"
"use server";

import { createServerAction } from "../utils/server-actions";
import { z } from "zod";

const schema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(8),
});

export const signIn = createServerAction<typeof schema>(
  schema,
  // highlight-next-line
  async (values, { user }) => {
    // Your login logic using the context-provided user
    return { ok: true };
  },
);
```

With this setup, you only need to define logic like `getUser()` once, making your actions more reusable and maintainable.
